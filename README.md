## How it's made:
-Node.js: Used for server-side development.
-JavaScript (JS): Utilized for both client and server-side functionality.
-APIs: Integrated to enhance the application's features.
-MongoDB: Employed as the database to store habit data.
-The core functionality is implemented on the server side using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This involves sending requests to the server to handle message data. On the client side, event listeners are utilized. Users click buttons to initiate CRUD functions and interact with the application.

## How it works:
1. Users can input a message in the form
2. Users can delete their messages, or other user's messages
3. Users can like or dislike messages on the board

## What I learned:
A very basic app that works with the client and server side is actually, quite sophisticated. Putting JavaScript logic on the server side is a better way to work with functions to ensure other users can't change the logic from the web browser api; unless of course, they have access to the github file!
